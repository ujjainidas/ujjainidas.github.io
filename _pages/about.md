Hi! I study Computer Science at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu) in the [Turing Scholars](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/turing-scholars-honors-program) honors program, advised by [Dr. Amy Pavel](https://amypavel.com). I'm an HCI researcher excited about making learning and creativity accessible. I use community-centered approaches such as [co-design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09658) and iterative system development and evaluation to amplify the voices of people underserved by technology.

I've completed three internships at [Apple](https://www.apple.com), where I've worked on features for [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/) and [iOS UI/UX](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2025/06/19/use-3d-wallpaper-iphone/). I'm currently an engineer building camera software for visionOS, iOS, and macOS releases.
